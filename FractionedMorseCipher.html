        <h2>Let's change some text into other text</h2>

        <input id = "keyword" type = "text" size = "20" placeholder="Keyword" spellcheck="false">
        <input id = "input" type = "text" size = "20" placeholder="Input text" spellcheck="false">

        <button onclick = "encrypt()" class="hvr-grow"> Encrypt </button>
        <button onclick = "decrypt()" class="hvr-grow"> Decrypt </button>
        <button onclick="copyFunction()" class="hvr-grow">Copy output</button>

        This cipher is a lot more complex than the others on this site, text goes through
        several layers of encryption making the output a lot less predictable, the output
        changes based on the keyword as well as the possibility of the output being longer
        than the input, this cipher is very difficult to decipher by hand without knowing
        the keyword.

        <br>

        Try this cipher out, type your message into the input box and press the button labelled
        "Encrypt", and just like magic the output appears. To decrypt your now-secret message back
        to its original state, insert your text into the input box yet again, but this time press
        the button labelled "decrypt". This page also supports copy and paste, although it has limited
        functionality, you can copy your output to your clipboard using the "Copy output" button.

        <h2>More information</h2>

        The Fractionated Morse cipher first converts the plaintext to morse code, then enciphers
        fixed size blocks of morse code back to letters. This procedure means plaintext letters
        are mixed into the ciphertext letters i.e. one plaintext letter does not map to one
        ciphertext letter. This makes it more secure than e.g. substitution ciphers, but it
        can still be broken with some effort.

        <br>

        One of the benefits of the Fractioned Morse cipher is that it can encipher spaces and
        punctuation just as easily as letters. The ciphertext message will generally be of a
        similar length to the plaintext message, but often will have a slightly different number
        of characters.

        <br>

        Morse code is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on-off tones,
        lights, or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without
        special equipment. It is named for Samuel F. B. Morse, an inventor of the telegraph.
