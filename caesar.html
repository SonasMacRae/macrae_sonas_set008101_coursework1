      I chose Caesars Cipher as the first cipher for this webpage because I think
      it's a good starting point, it's simple enough to understand and interesting
      too. To use this cipher, type into the box labelled "Plain text" and use the
      drop down menu to choose your key to encrypt with, ('A' shifting the letters by
      0 places and 'Z' shifting the letters by 25 places) press the button that says
      "Encrypt", the encrypted message should appear. Now that you have your secret
      message you can press the button labelled "copy" which will copy the encrypted
      text to your clipboard and can then be pasted back into the input box for decryption.
      To decrypt a message back to its original state, press the button labelled "Decrypt".

      <h2>More about this cipher</h2>

      In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift
      cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely
      known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which
      each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number
      of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would
      be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after
      Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.[1]
      The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as
      part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigen√®re cipher, and still has
      modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet substitution
     ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers
     essentially no communication security.
