        <h2>Encrypt your message</h2>

        <input id = "keyword" type = "text" size = "20" placeholder="Keyword">

        To use this cipher, enter some text into the "input" box and enter a keyword into the
        input box labelled "keyword", once you are satisfied with your choice of inputs go ahead and <s>smack</s>
        press the "encryption" button.. Your encrypted message should appear in the output box, press the
        "Copy output" button to save your secret message to your clipboard.

        <br>

        To decipher a message enter text into the input area and hit the button labelled "Decrypt".

        What is today known as the Vigenère Cipher was actually first described by Giovan Battista
        Bellaso in his 1553 book La cifra del. Sig. Giovan Battista Bellaso. However, in the 19th
        Century, it was misattributed to Blaise de Vigenère, who had presented a similar cipher

        <a href="http://crypto.interactive-maths.com/autokey-cipher.html">
          (The Auto Key cipher)</a> in 1586.

        At the time, and for many centuries since its invention, the Vigenère Cipher was renowned
        for being a very secure cipher, and for a very long time it was believed to be unbreakable.
        It was this thought that earned it the nickname "le chiffre indéchiffrable" (French for "the
        unbreakable cipher"). Although this is not true (it was fully broken by Friedrich Kasiski in 1863),
        it is still a very secure cipher in terms of paper and pen methods, and is usable as a field cipher.
