        To use this brilliant cipher, type text into the box that has "Input text"
        written in it and press the button labelled "Encrypt". This cipher works in
        such a way that you can keep pressing the "Encrypt" button to jumble up the
        output, but every jumbled up output can be deciphered back to the same original
        text every time. The only explanation is witchcraft. All encrypted messages have spaces
        removed, to decrypt a message, insert text into the input box and press the "decrypt"
        button.

        <br>

        The "copy output" button copies the output to your clipboard, this cipher is more complex
        than other ciphers such as the Caesar cipher and the atbash cipher, but arguably easier to crack
        since repeating numbers are common, once 1 letter is deciphered properly and the pattern is exposed;
        any encrypted message is straight forward to decrypt by hand.

        <h2>This cipher's name is as real as mine</h2>
        This is a cipher that I thought of myself, I got the idea from
        the image displayed at the bottom right of this page. This is a simple substitution
        cipher where every letter in the English alphabet can be substituted with one of 4
        double digit numbers, apart from the letters 'wxyz' which can only be one of 3
        double digit numbers. Encryption is very simple, for every letter inputted, choose
        one of the possible outputs. To decipher the encryption all you need to know is which
        numbers correspond to which letters in the alphabet.

        <br>

        To program this cipher I came up with an algorithm which uses a random number generator
        and simple maths to encrypt a message, and straight forward maths to decrypt a given
        encrypted message back to English.
